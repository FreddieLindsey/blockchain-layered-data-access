		Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Proxy Reencryption (CP-ABPRE) has found many practical applications in the real world, because it extends the traditional Proxy Reencryption (PRE) and allows a semitrusted proxy to transform a ciphertext under an access policy to the one with the same plaintext under another access policy. The existing CP-ABPRE schemes were proven secure only in the selective security model, a limited model, which is an unnatural constraint on the attacker. The scheme proved in this model can only be called selectively secure one. However, from a security perspective, the adaptively secure CP-ABPRE scheme is more desirable. In this paper, an adaptively secure CP-ABPRE scheme is proposed, which is based on Waters’ dual system encryption technology. The proposed scheme is constructed in composite order bilinear groups and proven secure under the complexity assumptions of the subgroup decision problem for 3 primes (3P-SDP). Analyses show that our proposal provides higher computational efficiency compared with the existing schemes.

		Data outsourcing services have emerged with the increasing use of digital information. They can be used to store data from various devices via networks that are easy to access. Unlike existing removable storage systems, storage outsourcing is available to many users because it has no storage limit and does not require a local storage medium. However, the reliability of storage outsourcing has become an important topic because many users employ it to store large volumes of data. To protect against unethical administrators and attackers, a variety of cryptography systems are used, such as searchable encryption and proxy reencryption. However, existing searchable encryption technology is inconvenient for use in storage outsourcing environments where users upload their data to be shared with others as necessary. In addition, some existing schemes are vulnerable to collusion attacks and have computing cost inefficiencies. In this paper, we analyze existing proxy re-encryption with keyword search.

		A time-bound hierarchical key assignment scheme is a method to assign time-dependent encryption keys to a set of classes in a partially ordered hierarchy, in such a way that each class can compute the keys of all classes lower down in the hierarchy, according to temporal constraints. In this paper we consider the unconditionally secure setting for time-bound hierarchical key assignment schemes and distinguish between two different goals: security with respect to key indistinguishability and against key recovery. We first present definitions of security with respect to both goals; then, we prove a tight lower bound on the size of the private information distributed to each class; finally, we show an optimal construction for time-bound hierarchical key assignment schemes.
