Over the last several hundred years, the way we access and manage the world's data has radically changed. Recounting medieval times when there was little to no public record of a person's assets or information, this presents a stark comparison to today's society, where our data and identities are traded on a global market, often without our knowledge. This paper, and it's accompanying proof of concept, seeks to describe a method of reinstating the ownership of data that was once commonplace in previous centuries, without compromising on the free flowing and global nature of communication today.
