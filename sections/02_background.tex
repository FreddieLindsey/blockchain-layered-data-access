\section{Background}

As a pre-face to any possible design and implementation choices, the following three sections cover revelant background material. Distributed ledger technology is considered as a means of decentralised compute. Proxy re-encryption is covered as a possible means through which encrypted data sharing is possible. Finally, possible storage solutions are covered, particularly in the context of a decentralised platform.
