\subsection{Contributions}

In line with the objectives of this thesis, the result of this project is the creation of a proof of concept decentralised platform where users can share their data privately without intermediataries. The platform not only allows peer-to-peer sharing, but allows companies and organisations to interact with and contribute to user data.

The main contributions of this project include the permissioning system built on the blockchain, including group access. Combined with end-to-end encryption and decentralisation, this affords the proof of concept to act as a real-world data sharing platform. Whilst the accessibility of the project is limited to those most technically aware, the platform shows strong potential that it functions and achieves its objectives at a fundamental level.
