\section{User journeys}

To succesfully implement and solve the problems addressed above, certain constraints must be adhered to by the application. Inherently, these make the application more complex, but bring fundamental benefit to the user. Largely, they make no 'business sense', however, more importantly, they do make sense to society.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Private keys must be held only by the user to which they belong
  \item Public keys are publicly available
  \item Session tokens to manage access remain secure
  \item API is public such that it provides an extensible platform for the user
\end{itemize}}

\subsection{Uploading a file}

\begin{itemize}
  \item User encrypts file locally
  \item Encrypted file is sent to API
  \item Encrypted file is stored on Persistent Storage
\end{itemize}}
