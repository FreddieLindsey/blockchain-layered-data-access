\subsubsection{Encrypting Large Data}

\textit{Using an asymmetric cryptography scheme, 'large data' refers to data larger than 385 bytes.}

When applying the cryptography schemes mentioned above, which have been specifically designed to sign and encrypt short messages and data, we must be aware of the problem of encrypting large data such that it remains decryptable using an asymmetric cryptography scheme.
