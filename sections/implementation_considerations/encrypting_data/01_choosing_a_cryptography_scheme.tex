\subsubsection{Choosing A Cryptography Scheme}

Fundamental to this project is the underlying end-to-end encryption of data. Without end-to-end encryption this project represents nothing more than a public ledger of the distribution of the files belonging to an identity, readable by any party. Henceforth, choosing a suitable and secure cryptography scheme is critical.

Firstly, an asymmetric cryptography scheme with a public-private key pair is required in order to facilitate proxy re-encryption. As the
