\subsubsection{Micro Architecture}

Distributed ledger technology is at the very core of any decentralised project. In this project, it provides the compute backbone, the only non-local, stateful system in the project architecture. Whilst this compute backbone has, until now, been observed as a monolithic module, we now consider it's implementation and own micro-architecture.
