\subsubsection{Individual Permissions}

For the purposes of this section, an individual refers to an individual identity. This may be held by an organisation or by a person, and is someone to whom the data owner directly gives permissions.

There are several considerations to make when giving another identity permissions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 
  	\textbf{Access Control} \\
    The ability of an individual to get access to the location of a file
  \item
  	\textbf{Read} \\
    The ability of an individual to read the contents of a file, correctly.
  \item
    \textbf{Write} \\
    The ability of an individual to write the contents of a file, correctly.
\end{itemize}
