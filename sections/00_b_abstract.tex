Over the last several hundred years, the way we access and manage the world's data has radically changed. Recounting medieval times when there was little to no public record of a person's assets or information, this presents a stark comparison to today's society, where our data and identities are traded on a global market, often without our knowledge.

This thesis, and it's accompanying proof of concept, seeks to investigate a method of reinstating the ownership of personal data that was once commonplace in previous centuries, without compromising on the free flowing and global nature of communication today.

Through the use of blockchain technology and alternative cryptography schemes, I present a proof of concept implementation that allows sharing data privately without the need for a centralised intermediatary. Through a practical use of proxy re-encryption, the process of atomically re-encrypting data from one identity to another, end-to-end encryption and privacy are preserved throughout the system.
