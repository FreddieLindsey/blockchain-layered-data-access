Over the last several hundred years, the way we access and manage the world's data has radically changed. Recounting medieval times when a person's public record contained a comparatively much smaller amount of information, this presents a stark comparison to today's society, where our data and identities are traded on a global market, often without our knowledge.

This report, and it's accompanying proof of concept, seeks to prove that it is possible to have a de-centralised system that provides the data integrity and availability desired by corporations without compromising the transparency and access control desired by their user. The system thereby aims to reinstate the ownership of data that was once commonplace in previous centuries, without compromising on the free flowing and global nature of today's communication technologies. To do this, the project endeavours to provide a layered data access model built atop blockchain technology (or similar) utilising off-chain, peer-to-peer, distributed storage in a secure manner.
