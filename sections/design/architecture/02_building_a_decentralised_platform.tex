\subsubsection{Building A Decentralised Platform}

Before any implementation details can be discussed, I must first establish the technology that will be used in the architecture of the system.

\subsubsection{Blockchain Technology}

As per the architecture criteria, the correct blockchain technology to use for this project is one compatible with an already developed and established public network. The four considered networks were Blockchain (Bitcoin), Ethereum (Ether), Hyperledger, and R3 Corda. Whilst the blockchain technology being used for the project remains as only a proof of concept, the exact technology and it's shortcomings are not completely relevant. For this project, the exact cost of transacting with a particular chain will not be considered, with the ease of use, ability to integrate, and security proving to be the priority.

With this said, two networks, Ethereum and Hyperledger, appear to be suitable for an application of this nature. The latter even offers a solution to the problem of certain transactions being private, by only existing on chains run by parties authorised to view such a transaction. However, in terms of implementation, Ethereum offers the most attractive developer experience at the time of writing.
