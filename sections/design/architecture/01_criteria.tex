\subsubsection{Platform Philosophy}

% Decentralisation allows 100% access and availability
As a project concerned with the privacy and security of user information as a top priority, the ability for the system to be autonomous and not require centralised management by some body is crucial. It is therefore crucial that the project endeavours to create a completely decentralised solution however possible. Any compromises to this architecture choice represent a possible compromisation of a user's data, likely in terms of access and availability.

% Management overhead
Furthermore, and of particular importance to a health care provider, the project should endeavour to remove current overheads due to more and more complicated software architecture and deployment. A health care provider's main priority should always be their ability to give care, not to manage IT systems.

% Integration with current systems
Whilst difficult, the technology used by the project should be able to integrate with current technology wherever possible. With some health care providers using software that was designed nearly twenty years ago, this is a key criteria. If the work done by this project proves very difficult to successfully implement in production and require a complete overhaul of a hospital's IT systems it is unlikely that any health care provider would be interested any more in the benefits of the project than the significant downtime due to installation.
