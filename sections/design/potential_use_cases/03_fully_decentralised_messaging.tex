\subsubsection{Fully Decentralised Messaging}

Following on from the health care use case detailed above, and of particular relevance at a time when the UK government looks to target the privacy of users online~\footnote{UK Prime minister Theresa May's suggestion of a regulated internet likely includes restrictions on the encryption of data. \href{http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/theresa-may-internet-conservatives-government-a7744176.html}{\textit{Independent}}}, a fully decentralised, autonomous messaging system could provide a global social movement to protect the privacy of individual conversations.

As per the health care use case, being fully decentralised would be critical to the application's success. By being decentralised, no one party would have ownership of the system and it would be impossible for any one party to shutdown the system if, for example, a government requested this. For those in war-torn areas, or areas where the internet is a restricted commodity, the execution of this idea would be profound.
