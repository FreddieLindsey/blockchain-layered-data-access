\subsubsection{Healthcare Data}

The notion of completely decentralised healthcare data is certainly an attractive one. Firstly, it doesn't put the onus on any one hospital, doctor's surgery, or sub-contractor to uphold the security of a network, but on the network as a whole. Secondly, there is not a centralised repository of data which could be compromised rather the network's data is contained across multiple sites with many thousands of hosts.
