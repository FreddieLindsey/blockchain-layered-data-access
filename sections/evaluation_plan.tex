\section{Evaluation Plan}

During the ideation stage of the project, and as part of my research to determine the criteria that would need to be met to deem the project a success, I quickly determined that a case study would be vital to give the project some context. As one of the largest markets for private data shared by a public company, I agreed with my supervisor that a suitable case study would be to provide secure accessible storage to front digital health data in the UK.

Further to agreeing this, I have received input from an industry specialist, Dr. Robert Learney\footnote{Dr. Learney is a Dyson scholar from the Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London}, in the field of digital health data. We discussed the current situation of digital health data in the UK market, with particular reference to the National Health Service~\footnote{\url{http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx}} (NHS) and what would be a requirement of a proof of concept that would solve some of the many issues with the current distribution and storage of current health data.

From discussions as above, the following represent the current evaluation criteria:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Store data in an encrypted manner such that it is only readable by it's owner}
  \item{Allow the transfer of data to nominated 3rd parties (including institutions) which remains encrypted from end-to-end}
  \item{Ensure the accessing of data is logged in a transparent and public manner, but such that only the true owner of the data is able to see and verify all logs}
  \item{Verify that the accessing of a user's account maliciously does not allow the attacker to read a user's data}
  
\end{itemize}

% User feedback is necessary
% Comprehensive user feedback
% Concrete evidence of success: quantitative
