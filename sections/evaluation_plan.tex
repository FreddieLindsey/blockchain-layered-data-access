\section{Evaluation Plan}

\subsection{Evaluation using a concrete use-case}

During the ideation stage of the project, and as part of my research to determine the criteria that would need to be met to deem the project a success, I quickly determined that a case study would be vital to give the project some context. As one of the largest markets for private data shared by a public company, I agreed with my supervisor that a suitable case study would be to provide secure accessible storage to front digital health data in the UK.

Further to agreeing this, I have received input from an industry specialist, Dr. Robert Learney\footnote{Dr. Learney is a Dyson scholar from the Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London}, in the field of digital health data. We discussed the current situation of digital health data in the UK market, with particular reference to the National Health Service~\footnote{\url{http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx}} (NHS) and what would be a requirement of a proof of concept that would solve some of the many issues with the current distribution and storage of current health data.

The core criteria that this project must adhere to are:

\begin{outline}
  \1 Secure distributed storage
  \1 Time-based access
  \1 Transparent, public logging
  \1 Secure access and access management
\end{outline}

Below, I have applied the use-case to the above criteria to outline the most significant output criteria to determine the project's success.

\subsection{Secure Distributed Storage}

\begin{outline}
  \1 Store data in an encrypted manner such that it is only readable by it's owner
  \1 Data input and output should never be decrypted - this should be provable
  \1 Verify that the accessing of a user's account maliciously does not allow the attacker to read a user's data
  \1 Show the transmission of data from a PACS server using an API
\end{outline}

\subsection{Time-based Access}

\begin{outline}
  \1 Allow the transfer of data to nominated 3rd parties (including institutions)
  \1 Access to data is time-dependent using two inputs:
    \2 Set remaining time period
    \2 Set access termination date
\end{outline}

\subsection{Transparent and Public Logging}

\begin{outline}
  \1 Ensure the accessing of data is logged in a transparent and public manner, but such that only the true owner of the data is able to see and verify all logs
\end{outline}

\subsection{Secure Access and Access Management}

% User feedback is necessary
% Comprehensive user feedback
% Concrete evidence of success: quantitative
