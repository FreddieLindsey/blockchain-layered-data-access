\section{Project Plan}

Over the course of the project, there will be several stages and for each of these stages an associated key milestone. Throughout this process, a mixture of research, discovery, implementation, and user testing must occur in order to give the project a well-rounded and well-evaluated outcome.

Below, I explain the desired timeline of the project and indicate when I intend to reach specific milestones.

    \textbf{10th February} & Complete Interim Report (Draft) \\
                           & At this point crucial research should have been undertaken to understand the viability of the project and to be able to assess it's preliminary chances of success. \\
                           [4ex]
    \textbf{17th February} & Prototype architecture \\
                           & Whilst working on preliminary architecture, the implementation of core features should have begun. By this point a more structured and well understood architecture should be written. \\
                           [4ex]
    \textbf{3rd March}     & Evaluate and consider second marker's comments
                           and advice \\
                           & After discussions with the second marker to the project, evaluate the points of concern and any advice on how to achieve the greatest success with the project. Move forward with this in mind and adjust any proposed plans or process as necessary. \\
                           [4ex]
    \textbf{5th March}     & First working prototype \\
                           & A basic working prototype must include the ability to read and write data at a basic level \\
                           [4ex]
    \textbf{7th May}       & Second working prototype \\
                           & A second working prototype should be made by this point. It must include basic desktop functionality and the ability to use multiple accounts to access 3rd party data (at different levels). \\
                           [4ex]
    \textbf{15th May}      & Project Health Checkup \\
                           & Given the length of time between here and the working prototype having been demonstrated to the supervisor in March, by this point some evaluation should be done in terms of reconsidering what the final goals are for the project in the remaining month. \\
                           [4ex]
    \textbf{19th June}     & Final Report Due \\
                           [4ex]
    \textbf{26th June}     & Submission of Project Archive
