\section{Implementation Considerations}

Since the core requirements of the project are architecture-independent to some degree, a simple solution which is not fully decentralised is a good option to begin with.

At current, a potential implementation utilises the following technologies:

\begin{outline}
  \1 AWS S3
  \1 AWS EB
  \1 AWS RDS
  \1 Ethereum
  \1 Electron
\end{outline}

The application would be distributed such that it could run on desktop operating systems (Mac and Linux (Debian) initially\footnote{Deployment of other packages may incur more overhead unnecessary at this point}). This means that the backend services of the project would be distinct from any front-end, whilst a public API offers the opportunity for third parties to contribute data and encourage user adoption.

The backend services of the project would be fulfilled to some extent by the following architecture:
