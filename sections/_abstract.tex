% It is apparent that privacy of data (especially of a personal nature and especially in domains like health care) is one of the most important issues of modern times. A key ingredient that currently seems to be missing is the ability for the owner of a piece of data to provide "layered" access to it - so that - subject to rigorous authentication checks - different stakeholders get access to it at different levels of detail (e.g. your GP's receptionist might be able to see you have had an X-ray, but not the X-ray itself, while your GP gets to see everything). Perhaps blockchains are natural choices for storing the relevant permissions for data access - although perhaps not for the data itself.

% The challenge for you would be to build a prototype blockchain-mediated data control system which allows such layered access to data. Researchers in the Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering have a few ideas as to how such a scheme could be made to work; we would be happy to discuss them with you. If successful, this project has very high potential impact.

Over the last several hundred years, the way we access and manage the world's data has radically changed. Recounting medieval times when there was little to no public record of a person's assets or information, this presents a stark comparison to today's society, where our data and identities are traded on a global market, often without our knowledge. This paper, and it's accompanying proof of concept, seeks to describe a method of reinstating the ownership of data that was once commonplace in previous centuries, without compromising on the free flowing and global nature of communication today.
