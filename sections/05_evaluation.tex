\section{Evaluation}

This section of the thesis follows a technical evaluation of the implementation described. Furthermore, an evaluation of the technical choices made and how these would change the output. Finally, a consideration of whether the project has been successful by evaluating its assumptions with regards to security, scalability and appropriateness of how it solves the problem laid out.

\subsection{Technical}

\subsubsection{Key safety}

At the heart of the security model of this application lies the underlying security of Ethereum's (and more generally blockchain) security model and the security of the cryptography scheme used for encryptions.

\paragraph{User-held keys}

A fundamental issue with creating a decentralised system, certainly under the proposed implementation, is the issue of private key storage. Without a central authority managing the identities within the system each user is expected to securely store their keys. Failure to do so will result in account compromises possibly including corruption of data, changing of permissions, and taking control of an identity's contract. Owing to the transaction history available through a blockchain, previous data references are recoverable in the event of a compromise.

However, if a user loses either of their keys (identity or encryption) there are serious consequences.

If a user loses their identity key, it is impossible to prove that they own the address. This means that they would no longer have any control over their contract(s) with current permissions remaining and irrevokable. The user would not be able to share any further content or upload any references to content that they owned. Only a local (non-blockchain) record of all their data references would allow them to retrieve their data.

At this point I consider a possible solution to the problem of losing the identity key. If a future implementation allowed the user to delegate certain identities as privileged on their contract(s) it might be possible to regain access. These privileged identities would be able to form a quorum which would allow the transfer of a contract's properties to another, new, contract with a new identity. The practical implementation of this would be difficult, and it is likely that the transaction history of the original contract could not be maintained by the new contract.

If a user loses their encryption key, they are unable to directly decrypt data. With the implementation proposed there is no mechanism for them to recover their data other than through collusion with other identities with whom they have shared their data. Taking a similar stance to the identity key loss problem above, creating backup encryption keys which are given full access to the data in one's contract, and allowing the use of these under a quorum of privileged users would be a possible solution to the encryption key loss problem. In this scenario, there is a slight security loss, but this is negligible in practice.

\paragraph{Identity Spoofing}

Under the current implementation, access to one's storage contracts or group contracts are determined by the identity of their key. Every account (address) on an Ethereum network is a 20 byte value. These 20 bytes represent the last 20 bytes of the SHA-3 (Keccak) hash of the public key of the account holder. This public key is the counterpart to a 256-bit ECDSA private key which is used to unlock the account and sign transactions. An example of this derivation is found in table \ref{table:ethereum_ecdsa_address_derivation}.

\input{figures/ethereum_ecdsa_address_derivation}

The major concern for this system is identity spoofing. If a party has access to the private key associated with a specific ethereum address

Given that the ethereum address associated with any private key is 20 bytes, this gives $2^{160}$ possible addresses in the system. This means the probability of
guessing your address is extremely low ($6.8 \times 10^{-49}$). Whilst an identity's address can be public, this in itself provides a layer of obscurity.

With the public key is hashed, unless the user chooses reveal it, the public key remains private under the security provided by the given hash function. Therefore, no attacker gains (with respect to the challenge of acquiring the private key associated with an address) from knowing your address.

The 256-bit private key provides the main layer of security for an identity. With $2^{256}$ possible key values, the challenge of determining the private key corresponding to a public key (or identity's address) is hard. For each key possibility, the key must be used to generate a public key, which is hashed and the last 20 bytes compared. This is what will be referred to as a key check. Using a python script~\footnote{10,000 iterations of checking a private key against an address. Uses script in program code \ref{code:secp256k1_benchmark} (Appendix)} on a modern laptop~\footnote{MacBook Pro 13-inch. OS X 10.12.5. Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5257U CPU @ 2.70GHz. 8GB RAM.} with floating point performance of the order of 3.46 GFLOPS/s per core, a rate of 120 key checks per second can be achieved. On average $2^{255}$ tries will be required to produce the correct key.

$$
2^{255} \div (120 \times 3600 \times 24 \times 365) = 1.53 \times 10^{67} \text{ years}
$$

As of June 2016, the fastest supercomputers in the world have a potential of roughly 100 PFLOPS ($10^8$ GFLOPS)~\footnote{China builds world's fastest supercomputer.  \href{http://www.computerworld.com/article/3085483/high-performance-computing/china-builds-world-s-fastest-supercomputer-without-u-s-chips.html}{\textit{Computer World}}}. Even so, using current chipsets it would still take $10^{59}$ years to find the private key.

$$
1.53 \times 10^{67} \div (10^8 \div 3.46) = 5.29 \times 10^{59} \text{ years}
$$

Whilst computed using commodity hardware and an unoptimised script, the calculations shown illustrate the difficulty of determining and checking a 256-bit ECDSA (secp256k1) key against a known Ethereum address.

\paragraph{Breaking Data Encryption}

Stored on IPFS, the so-called 'permanent web', the quality of the encryption of personal data is of pivotal importance. The scheme uses a randomly generated symmetric key to encrypt the underlying data, which is itself encrypted by a user-specific public key. In this regard, a malicious attacker would have to either find the symmetric key or find the public key that unlocks the encrypted symmetric key. These challenges are defined by the security of the cryptography scheme and the key size used. For this project a 256-bit AES key and a 256-bit ElGamal key.

We assume that the underlying encryption is secure and that vulnerabilities are concerned with key leaks. This means that we do not consider cryptographic 'breaks', only that a key is found by brute force.

Fundamentally, there are $2^{256}$ possible keys to check against either the symmetric or asymmetric cryptography schemes. Assuming no information is given away by the public key of the asymmetric scheme, both schemes are equally secure requiring $2^{255}$ or $~5.8 \times 10^{76}$ trials to determine the key on average. Assuming a supercomputer has 100 petaflops and that this is a suitable measure of performance, it can generate $10^{17}$ keys per second. It will take $1.84 \times 10^{52}$ years on average to generate a suitable key for an encryption under a 256-bit scheme~\footnote{Not including the time taken to perform a decryption on a suitably small test encryption.}.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  10^{17} \times 3.6 \times 10^{3} \times 24 \times 365 &=& 3.1536 \times 10^{24} \text{ keys per year} \\
  \frac{2^{255}}{3.1536 \times 10^{24}} &=& 1.84 \times 10^{52} \text{ years}
\end{aligned}
$$
