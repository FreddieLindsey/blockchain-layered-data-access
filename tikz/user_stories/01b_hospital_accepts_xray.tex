    Hospital accepts a doctor's request for an X-ray
  }{
    The hospital accepts the request, made by the doctor, for the patient's X-ray. This paves the way for the hospital and the patient to negotiate a time for the appointment. \textit{Note: whilst the hospital is shown as having some $ID_{H}$ above, in reality this might be the id of an administrator of X-ray requests who is a member of a hospital administration group (similar to the GMC for doctors).}
