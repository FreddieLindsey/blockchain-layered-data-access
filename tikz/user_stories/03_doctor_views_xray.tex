  \caption{Doctor views X-ray with patient}{
  	The patient visits the doctor to discuss their X-ray results. The doctor gets the latest version (address / hash) of their X-ray data from their record and using this gets the X-ray data itself from off-chain storage. The doctor is then able to discuss the results with the patient (and make further edits - \textit{not shown}.
