    Potential architecture for proof of concept. Shows links between different systems using green, dashed lines. Each inner box referring to a specific service within a location (public or private). All links are made over public infrastructure.\textit{The Electron application that will be built as part of this proof of concept is assumed to be one of many front-end clients.}
